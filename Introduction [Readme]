Information Technology Competition - IT Strategy (2nd Place) | May 2020 - April 2020 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Information Technology Competition (ITC) hosted by Management Information Systems Student Association (MISSA) is a case competition hosted at Cal Poly Pomona open
to the public competitors from various universities. 

I stepped out of my comfort zone and competed with my team, Chi Epsilon Consulting, at Cal Poly Pomona MISSA's 24th Annual Information Technology Case Competition in 
the IT Strategy category. I’m beyond overjoyed that our team placed second!

As a student who is beginning to scratch the surface of information security, this competition challenged me to learn how to combine IT analytics with business and 
marketing methods to create a comprehensive strategy to solve a complex real-world problem as well as analyzing compliance frameworks according to client requirements.

Apart from developing technical skills, this competition has taught me valuable interpersonal skills. Collaborating with Sheldon, Matthew, Derek, and Quyen allowed
me to gain different perspectives. I’m extremely grateful to have such a knowledgeable and diverse team in terms of majors. This experience has definitely piqued 
my interests in consulting.
